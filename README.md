# Mimic-8D
A REALLY simple apple script application that adjusts left and right audio balance to provide a real time, system audio "8D" experience.

FAQ:

Q) Why do I need to give Mimic8D Accessability Permissions?

A) Mimic8D works by changing the left and right balance of you speakers (or headphones) in settings for you. In other words, it drags the slider back and forth for you which requires controlling your computer.
